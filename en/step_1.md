## Setting up the AIY Voice Kit

- To begin you need to use the plastic *standoffs* to help support the Voice Kit HAT, when it is attached to the Raspberry Pi. Insert the standoffs into the mounting holes opposite the GPIO pins.

- You can now place the HAT onto the Raspberry Pi. Just make sure that the pins are all aligned.

- Next you can attach the speaker to the kit. This needs to be wired in a particular way. The red wire needs to be connected into the hole closest to the Raspberry Pi's Ethernet port. The black wire goes into the other hole. Use a Phillip's screwdriver to secure the wires in place.

- Now it's time to connect the microphone to it's leads. The connectors only fit one way, so this shouldn't be too difficult.

- The trickiest part is assembling the button. You'll need the button and the LED housing to begin with

- The LED housing can be inserted into the button and twisted to secure it in place.

- Then the switch needs attaching. This can be awkward. The switch needs to align it's holes with the pegs on the LED housing. Just make sure that thee small button (here it is yellow) is positioned closest to the button.

- Now you can attach the leads to the button.
